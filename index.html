        <h3>Caleb Pope</h3>

Using hashtag slogans to inspire a movement that he started after he posted a video calling on men to stop acting like everything is fine when it comes to gender violence.

His truth gained him many views and interactions from women who were grateful that he was a man speaking out.</p>

        <h3>Yvonne Habiba</h3>
        <p>In the autobiographical book 'Masaibu Yetu', Habiba shares her collected stories of rape, prostitution, and human trafficking. Her narration brought to light the endured years of nightmare rooted in prostitution, drug addiction, and poverty. She helps us see that when you know and you see men that are rapists, that have killed women or committed gender-based violence on the streets, still in the township, still in the tavern, still in the clubs, especially the high-profile officials that are using women for sexual exploitation and after that just silence them. She helps us understand the challenges of speaking out.</p>
